<h3>CPU and Video card performance</h3>
<p class="question">My computer and/or graphics card isn't powerful enough to run GNOME 3.</p>
<p class="answer">GNOME 3 uses relatively primitive 3D capabilities that have been available from essentially all computing devices made in the last 4 or 5 years. This includes most desktop and laptop computers, mobile devices, phones, tablets, and netbooks. Where there are exceptions, largely, there are bugs we can and should fix.

So, the official plan is basically that people can still use the GNOME 2 shell with GNOME 3 applications and libraries, if necessary, but this is a transitional state, and to get the GNOME 3 experience, you need hardware acceleration. </p>

<h3>Shell vs. Panel & Metacity</h3>
<p class="question">GNOME won't support the current panel and window manager anymore.</p>
<p class="answer">While it is true that the GNOME 3 experience will not include the panel as it was in GNOME 2, the window manager used in GNOME 3 will use a window manager that behaves consistently with the GNOME 2 window manager (metacity). This is because it uses most of the same code. It is important to emphasize that GNOME 2 technologies will still be available through the usual channels for some time. Downstream distributions such as Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu will have the option to include them in their distribution.</p>

<h3>Nautilus vs. Activity journal</h3>
<p class="question">The GNOME file manager (Nautilus) will be removed from GNOME and replaced with the GNOME Activity Journal!</p>
<p class="answer">Nautilus will still be available as the default GNOME file manager.
In fact, Nautilus is going through a number of changes to help with GNOME 3.0 integration, such as using browser mode by default (rather than spatial) as GNOME Shell has some overlapping features. This mailing list post has more information. </p>

<h3>Apps written in GTK+ ver. 2</h3>
<p class="question">My favorite GNOME 2 apps won't work with GNOME 3 and I'll have to wait for ages before they get ported.</p>
<p class="answer">Applications will not require changes to work in GNOME 3. However, application authors will want to take advantage of the advancements in GNOME 3 and will likely port applications as time allows. </p>
